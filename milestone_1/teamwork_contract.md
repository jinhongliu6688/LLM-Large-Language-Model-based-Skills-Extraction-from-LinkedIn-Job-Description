## Teamwork contract for Ashwin, Jaskirat, Jinhong, Rakesh, Sai

- Purpose: Our team's purpose is to work collaboratively to achieve our project goals, which are to explore the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT for data annotation and develop a more efficient and effective way to train models using labelled data.

- Communication: We will primarily communicate on Slack and in-person, and have 3 weekly calls (on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday),  to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the week's milestone. In addition, team members are encouraged to communicate as needed to ensure effective collaboration.

- Timeline: We aim to finish our weekly work by Friday and use Saturday for any last-minute modifications or improvements.

- Roles and Responsibilities: Each team member's roles and responsibilities will be split every week based on the expectations for that week. We will assign tasks based on our individual strengths and preferences.

- GitHub Repo Management: Any team member (except for the one who raised the Issue) can review and accept a Pull Request (PR).

This will allow us to distribute the workload and ensure that our code is reviewed thoroughly.

- Decision-making: Our team will operate democratically, and no one person will have authority over the others. Decisions will be made through a majority vote, and in the event of a tie, we will either consider a new idea or try to get a mediator (professor or TA) to help us reach a resolution.
