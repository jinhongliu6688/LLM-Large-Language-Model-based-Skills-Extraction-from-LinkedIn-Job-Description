Serve as a mentor for junior engineers and participate in scaling our teamWho You AreWe’re actively hiring full stack, front-end, and back-end developers across all levels (SWE, Senior, Staff, Principal). You have 2+ years of software engineering experience. You enjoy working cross functionally with leadership, PMs, designers, and other engineers to build products across a modern tech stack (MERN) to solve complex problems. You are eager to work in a dynamic and fast-paced early stage startup, and have an ability to roll up your sleeves to #GetShiftDone. Operating Principles @ ShiftsmartSee Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)Execution Is BinaryWe #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done”.Missionaries, Not MercenariesWe before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.Inputs > OutcomesWe work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.Honesty Over HarmonyWe share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it.We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.Invent & IterateWe are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done”, and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders.We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.Compensation Range: $120K - $220K",Entry level,Full-time

We started our journey at McGill University’s urban planning department, where we came to see that cities were being developed in all kinds of unsustainable ways. Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. But we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities that we so desperately need.Today, Local Logic delivers sophisticated location insights through webtools, APIs, one-click reports and a data analytics platform. Our insights are powered by billions of data points we’ve generated that describe all aspects of cities -- from the distance to the nearest bus stop, the quietness on a street, to the most recent trends in the housing market and more.Your MissionAs Data Scientist at Local Logic, you will be responsible for quantitative research on cities and real estate, on the one hand, and our product usage, on the other hand – all with the goal of helping to inform product strategy and to discover hidden value in our city and real estate data.You are an agile researcher and strategist at your core, able to rapidly and creatively identify the right questions to ask, help others reframe their questions so they uncover bigger opportunities, understand the value of combining quantitative and qualitative exploratory and evaluative methods, and are excited about doing this at variable speeds and depths to respond to a constantly evolving start-up environment.You believe in our mission and want to help us achieve it. You bring your own unique perspective to the team, so you can challenge the way we do things for the better. You’re able to speak up when you disagree, ask questions when you don’t understand, and take ownership of your work.We’re a remote-enabled company, so if you want to work remotely once a week, twice a week, or five days a week, you’ll have all the necessary tools and support you need to do so.Why Should You Work Here?At Local Logic, you have an amazing opportunity to be an early team member of an expanding series A backed startup. We are focused on understanding the world and its cities to predict the future, and make the real estate market more transparent.We are a people first company that strives to create the best experience for our employees by creating an inclusive, collaborative, challenging environment to learn and problem solve on a daily basis.You will have access to benefits such as: stock options; comprehensive health, dental and vision plans for you and your family; annual coverage for paramedical services like massage, nutrition and naturopathy; telemedicine service for employees and their families; a culture that emphasizes learning and work-life harmony; unlimited vacation; Intentional Fridays; discretionary health and benefits credit.To support our company value of being Growth Oriented, employees are given a $500 annual professional development credit.Our Commitment to Diversity & InclusionWe’re aiming to build a diverse team and inclusive company culture.
