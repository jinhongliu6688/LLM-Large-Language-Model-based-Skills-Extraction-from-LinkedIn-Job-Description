Operating Principles @ ShiftsmartSee Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)Execution Is BinaryWe #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done”.Missionaries, Not MercenariesWe before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.Inputs > OutcomesWe work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.Honesty Over HarmonyWe share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it.We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.Invent & IterateWe are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done”, and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders.We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.We do not let perfect get in the way of better.

Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors.', ""We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women (Tia), provide equitable access to birth control (Favor), lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more."", ""This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!Our valuesWe spend at least as much time with our coworkers as we do with our closest friends + family - if we intend to do the most important + challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work."", 'This is what you can expect of your teammates at Candid (in no particular order): - We put our customers first - We take care of each other and ourselves - We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them - We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace - We believe humility is our greatest strength - We are candid, kind, and committed - We strive to be the most prepared person in the room - We are truth seekersWhat you’ll be doingYou’ll conceptualize, design, build, and maintain complex services/platforms/features and develop ownership over large swaths of our product + infrastructure.You’ll interact closely with our current + prospective customers, developing intuition around their biggest pain points and thinking of creative ways to address them.You’ll play a critical role in shaping our engineering + broader company culture and help make this the best place we’ve ever worked.Who you areYou have Bachelors of Science or Bachelors of Art in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree.Experience with the technologies we currently use is a plus, but by no means required: Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, React, Typescript, Google Cloud Platform, Auth0, Terraform.You enjoy building high-quality software, but you also anchor on outcomes and have good intuition around which corners are worth cutting and which aren’t. You enjoy owning features end-to-end and are comfortable learning new tools or moving across the stack to do so.You have a customer-first and learner’s mindset, and value teaching others.You’re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms, both in-person and in writing.Pay TransparencyThe estimated starting annual salary range for this position is $135,000 to $230,000 USD.

At Trainual, be helpful everywhere possible."" - Chris Ronzio, CEONo Red Tape: Work hard to make every process easy.

We work with people in all different industries, from all different walks of life. In order to build trust, understand the real picture, and help create change, we need to build real relationships.

We’re looking for motivated, experienced technical leaders to help take our software to the next level of capability, quality, and impact. Do you have a background in GPS, WiFi location, or embedded sensing, and are looking to move up the stack?

Are you excited by the optimization problem of providing rich contextual intelligence within a constrained resource footprint? If any of these describe you, read on. Key Qualifications Real passion for the location domain. We believe that mobility is transformative, and that to realize that transformation, your devices need to understand the places you go and what they mean to you.

We think this is a really exciting challenge. If it sounds frustrating to you, this isn’t the right position.A proven track record working effectively across teams. One of the cool things about Apple is how much you will work with people who have different expertise and responsibilities than you: apps, sensors, connectivity, and others. You’ll need to communicate clearly, plan collaboratively, execute flexibly, and cope with what will sometimes feel like a high degree of uncertainty. Experience processing real-world data at scale, server-side. Not every candidate will have experience with Spark, Hadoop, or NoSQL data stores, but the best ones will. Description In this job, you’ll develop the next frontier of mobile technology, in partnership with teams in sensing, Siri, and apps. Hungry for the responsibility to work on complex problems from end to end?', ""In this position, you will:-  Conceptualize, explore, and define new inferential and predictive location- and motion-based capabilities for Apple's platforms.-  Collect, curate, and analyze real-world data sets of varying size and complexity.-  Aggregate, filter, and cluster data on mobile devices, from a variety of local sensors: GPS, WiFi, accelerometer, and others."", '-  Design and implement algorithms, then integrate them into production code.-  Test your work. Dog-food it. Collect metrics, and iterate. Don’t forget to sweat the edge cases—an issue that impacts 1% of a billion devices is a big issue.A dedication to users’ privacy and security is core to how Apple does business. We want their devices to exhibit the high level of intelligence and proactivity that can only come from deep contextual understanding. We don’t want their sensitive data coming back to Apple or being exposed to third parties. Other companies solve similar problems in very different ways. Our way is more work. We believe it’s worth it.
