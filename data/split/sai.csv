We started our journey at McGill University’s urban planning department, where we came to see that cities were being developed in all kinds of unsustainable ways. Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. But we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities that we so desperately need.Today, Local Logic delivers sophisticated location insights through webtools, APIs, one-click reports and a data analytics platform. Our insights are powered by billions of data points we’ve generated that describe all aspects of cities -- from the distance to the nearest bus stop, the quietness on a street, to the most recent trends in the housing market and more.Your MissionAs Data Scientist at Local Logic, you will be responsible for quantitative research on cities and real estate, on the one hand, and our product usage, on the other hand – all with the goal of helping to inform product strategy and to discover hidden value in our city and real estate data.You are an agile researcher and strategist at your core, able to rapidly and creatively identify the right questions to ask, help others reframe their questions so they uncover bigger opportunities, understand the value of combining quantitative and qualitative exploratory and evaluative methods, and are excited about doing this at variable speeds and depths to respond to a constantly evolving start-up environment.You believe in our mission and want to help us achieve it. You bring your own unique perspective to the team, so you can challenge the way we do things for the better.

We are focused on the energy intensive manufacturing industries; cement, steel, glass, etc. which are responsible for approximately 20% of global emissions and are referred to as ‘hard-to-abate industries’ for which there is currently no viable path to decarbonisation. Our mission is to develop Machine Learning products and solutions that can enable rapid decarbonisation of these industries. Initially this will involve improving and optimising the current manufacturing process but in the long term we aim to rethink and redesign these manufacturing systems for net-zero and accelerate the development of new climate-friendly materials and processes.We are delighted to have recently raised £4.2m in seed funding led by Planet A Ventures to help us scale up the deployment of our platform, develop new products and continue hiring the best talent in the world.What are we hiring for?We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our Machine Learning team, focused on improving the internal models that power our recommendation engines for industrial plants.You will work with time-series physical and chemical data to build deep learning models. Your goal will be to develop better and more performant models, and to improve our internal understanding of our growing datasets.Given the innovative and pioneering nature of our work, you will need to be an independent and creative problem solver capable of working under uncertainty on areas of critical importance to the company.We are also looking for someone with a genuine passion for our mission and a keen interest in researching how we can best optimise these complex industrial processes.You will primarily work in our shared codebase, using PyTorch as your daily driver.

We aim to create software that helps us achieve our mission in a sustainable and principled way, and to share our findings in the open through publications and open-source development.We are acting now. Due to the cumulative radiative forcing effect, one tonne of carbon saved today will help us meet global temperature targets as much as two tonnes saved in 2050.

Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. But we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities that we so desperately need.Today, Local Logic delivers sophisticated location insights through webtools, APIs, and integrated location reports.

This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.Experience PersonalizationOur team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.Personalization RankersOur core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms.
